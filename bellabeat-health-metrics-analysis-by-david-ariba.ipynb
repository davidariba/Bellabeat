People sleep the least on Fridays. Bellabeat needs to introduce new app features, programs or devices that remind people of the dangers of sleep deprivation and encourages them to sleep more on Fridays. If Bellabeat can provide data on the age of the users, analysis can be done to show the distribution of sleep per age range. This will also help determine the steps to take to improve sleep in the worst hit demographics. \n\nii. People sleep most on Sundays, with Sunday being the only day when the Median sleep time is more than the recommended 8 hours. Bellabeat could set each person's Sunday sleep as a benchmark per person. If a user can match their Sunday sleep time for a stretch of days, Bellabeat provides rewards like gifts and discounts. Of course, this won't work for everyone because we're basing our analysis on the median value, but it would be beneficial to most people. \n\niii. Bellabeat apps might also need to install reminders that make people walk more on the weekends, especially on Saturdays and Sundays which both have over 3000 on the Steps_left column. Walking is beneficial to health at all ages, and is one of the more easily completed fitness exercises. Getting people to take longer walks or move around more is a win for all sides. \n ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Similar analysis can also be made per person, rather than per day of the week. This would really help individual users because seeing their performance on simple health metrics like this can inform a user on the habits to inculcate and those to cut out. It would also help Bellabeat provide a more customisable service to each user. \n\nBy every indication, Bellabeats health tracking tools are useful in monitoring lifestyle quirks. But without providing insight after analysis, they can't be utilized to full capacity. Bellabeat needs to provide these analysis to each customer, maybe even comparing individual performance to mean or median metrics. \n\nLastly, I'm aware my analysis is far from robust. I ignored metrics like Calories, VeryActiveDistance, VeryActiveMinutes and SedentaryMinutes on the daily_activity dataset. And I could have also aggregated by ID or by date, rather than by day of the week. But I've only got so much time and I need to move on to other projects. I would do it on request though. I don't mind that. \n\nIf you're still reading at this point, you're a champ who deserves the world. Thank you for reading through this borefest. I'll be in the comments for any feedback.
